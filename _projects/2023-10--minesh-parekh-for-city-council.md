**I use video, audio and code to create social media and web content for Crookes and Crosspool Labour Partyâ€™s social media channels.** I co-ordinated the successful digital campaign for Minesh Parekh for City Council which won on a mandate of 37.5%

* I acquired responsibility for all stages, from coding the website and SEO to designing branding, filming campaign material and posting social media posts.
* The website was built from the ground up for accessibility using HTML, CSS, SCSS, JS and Ruby. A static site generator called Jekyll acted as the backend, as itâ€™s known for fast compilation, serving speeds, and low maintenance costs.
* The website digitalised analogue campaign tactics, allowing 55+ volunteers from across the city to sign up and get involved.
* By the end of the campaign, the social media posts gathered 86,000+ engagements across all social media platforms.
* Crookes & Crosspool elected Minesh Parekh by a mandate of 37.5% (+4.8), one of two Labour gains in Sheffield during the night.

The experience of co-ordinating a significant part of a political campaign, alongside balancing my first year of A Level, gave me the organisational, problem-solving and communication skills vital when working under a fast-paced organisation.
