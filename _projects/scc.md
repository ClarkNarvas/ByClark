I coordinated the successful digital campaign for Minesh Parekh for City Council. 

I was in control of all stages of the process, from creating the website and SEO to designing branding, filming campaign material and social media posts. The website was built from the ground up for accessibility using HTML, CSS and Ruby. A site generator called Jekyll acted as the backend, as itâ€™s known for fast compilation and serving speeds, as well as low maintenance costs. The experience of a political campaign gave me the problem-solving and communication skills vital when working under a fast-paced organisation.
