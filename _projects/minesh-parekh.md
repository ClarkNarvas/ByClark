In early 2022, I had the opportunity to co-lead Minesh Parekh for City Council's digital campaign. 

I worked on all platforms throughout the period of January to May, from creating the website and SEO to designing the brand identity, filming campaign material, and social media posts. 



### The Brand Identity 

A design philosophy I use in many of my projects is "when it's different, make it familiar; when it's familiar, make it different." Minesh was a very different candidate as he broke the  stereotypes of the typical councillor sitting in Town Hall: BAME, radical and one of the youngest candidates running in 2021. 

Completely ignoring the scale of change Minesh would bring wouldn't have been appropiate, I wanted to create some differenciation from previous Labour campaigns in the area while sticking to familiar codes and conventions. 

I kept many elements of the Labour Party branding while applying luxurious, popping gradients; the colour scheme was softened and used a wider variety of colours other than red and white; and I ensured consistency across calling cards, websites and social media material.

## The Website

*Can a website replace election leaflets?* No. 

*But can a website be as, or more influential towards a vote?* Yes. 


If election leaflets make you interested in the candidate, the website should allow you to engage with the candidate and learn what they stand for in greater detail. The Minesh Parekh website served this purpose, it enforced campaign messaging and allowed constituents to know every detail of what Minesh would stand for.
