![John Wright for Crookes & Crosspool - Experience to Deliver](https://res.cloudinary.com/dd8qv953j/image/upload/v1697320703/JW_Cover_Photo_1_._bhmthv.png "John Wright for Crookes & Crosspool")

In the 2023 elections, I co-ordinated the digital campaign for John Wright for Crookes & Crosspool. 

I filmed videos, produced social media content, signs and calling cards. I coded a website which allowed constituents to see information about John, voting information, and a feature to request a window sign. It was all produced to ensure minimal equipment and server costs. 

Social media content was scheduled to ensure a regular flow going out on social media channels until election day.
