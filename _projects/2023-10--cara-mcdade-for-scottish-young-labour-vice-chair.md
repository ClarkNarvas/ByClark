**I coordinated Cara McDade’s successful campaign to be elected as Scottish Young Labour’s Vice Chair.**

Our campaign started as the underdog: our main competitor was a Councillor with many connections and strong campaign experience. 

**I worked with her to form a campaign strategy and messaging to motivate and unite left and centrist voters behind her campaign.** We used social media platforms to collect data and allow members to ask questions to the candidate. Posts on her social media feed had clear policy proposals but also focused on her personality. 

The campaign messaging was "Together". We wanted to highlight Cara's stance as a unity candidate but also emphasise her Regional Groups policy, which would shift organising away from the executive committee to regional groups across the country, decentralising campaigning and bringing regions together. 

By the end of the election, while it was close, our campaign had the most momentum, and **Scottish Young Labour members elected her to be their Vice Chair.**
