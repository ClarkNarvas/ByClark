During Lewis Dagnall’s campaign to be Labour’s candidate for South Yorkshire Mayor, I created social media posts for the campaign used for member mobilisation and targeted advertisements. 

Additionally, I produced a Facebook livestream of the Zoom rally with graphics and call-to-actions with links to volunteering.
