As Sheffield City Council moved into no overall control, people felt discontented with all of the political parties at Town Hall. A new leadership recognised that Sheffield Labour needed to overhaul its messaging: **shout loud about its achievements and tell the city we're on the up**. 

In 2023 and 2024, **I was tasked with building a cohesive, standardised design identity to allow Sheffield Labour to boost its messaging.** 

A new logo was created, consistent with Labour Party branding and with in-line and stacked versions.

Inspired by movie posters, I created a design layout that put Sheffield Labour front and centre on its achievements and policies. This was coupled with easy-to-use Canva templates that were distributed across organisers, councillors and activists.

In 2024, this was paired with a new design element: **the ‘on the up’ arrow,** which aimed to create a feeling of upward momentum and optimism and acted as a design agent that emphasised specific information. It is featured throughout social media posts, banners and the manifesto document.

These design systems were created to match the Labour Party's national branding, using the same fonts and colours. 

Sheffield Labour’s 2024 campaign broke the deadlock in Sheffield City Council with an **increase of 5 seats.** Sheffield's voters delivered a clear mandate that they want Labour to continue building a better Sheffield.
